## NPM & GitHub Packages

https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages

You can configure npm to publish packages to GitHub Packages and to use packages stored on GitHub Packages as dependencies in an npm project.

#### Publishing a package using a local .npmrc file

You can use an 	`.npmrc` file to configure the scope mapping for your project. In the .npmrc file, use the GitHub Packages URL and account owner so GitHub Packages knows where to route package requests. Using an `.npmrc` file prevents other developers from accidentally publishing the package to npmjs.org instead of GitHub Packages

#### Publishing a package using a local `.npmrc` file

Publishing a package using publishConfig in the `package.json` file
You can use publishConfig element in the `package.json` file to specify the registry where you want the package published. For more information, see "publishConfig" in the npm documentation.

Edit the `package.json` file for your package and include a publishConfig entry.

```
"publishConfig": {
  "registry":"https://npm.pkg.github.com"
},
```

Verify the repository field in your project's package.json. The repository field must match the URL for your GitHub repository. For example, if your repository URL is github.com/my-org/test then the repository field should be git://github.com/my-org/test.git.

Publish the package:

```bash
npm publish
```
